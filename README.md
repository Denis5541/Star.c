# Star.c
 In this program:
- The `printStarPattern` function takes the number of rows as a parameter and prints the star pattern.
- It uses nested `for` loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the pattern.
- The outer loop (`i`) iterates from 1 to the total number of rows.
- The inner loop (`j`) is used to print the asterisks (`*`). In each row, the number of asterisks increases by 1.
- After printing each row, a newline character (`\n`) is printed to move to the next line.
- In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the number of rows for the star pattern using `printf` and `scanf`.
- The `printStarPattern` function is called with the provided number of rows to print the star pattern.
